      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <h3>Fields of Interest</h3>
      <p>I'm studying Computer Science for a very simple reason. I'm interested in how computers work and how they are used. I find the design of complex systems, such as the internet and operating systems, to be as fascinating as the processes that they facilitate and the people who use them.</p>
      <p>As a result my interests include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Network Security</li>
        <li>Cryptography</li>
        <li>Systems Performance</li>
        <li>Computer Graphics</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Why "xmasscan"?</h3>
      <p>In the most nascent days of my Cybersecurity career, during high school, I'd spend my free time reading through the <a href="https://nmap.org/book">official nmap book</a>, interesting in learning what I could about basic networking and network scanning.</p>
      <p>I very quickly noticed the "Xmas Scan", wherein the scanner abuses a trick implied by the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">TCP RFC</a>. Basically, if you send a packet to a port over TCP without SYN, RST, or ACK bits sent, you <em>should</em> recieve a RST packet in response so that you know something got messed up. Barring scanning, this behavior is most common when connections are choppy or drop in the middle of sending a packet.</p>
      <p>What matters, however, is that I found it to be a novel way to approach port scanning which taught me quite a bit about the way packets are constructed. It was what I would consider the true beginning of my formal interest in the field and it is what inspired my ongoing interest in pursuing a career within it.</p>
      <p>I chose to name my Github account after the scan because it remains a cool thing to tell people about, and it reminds me why I do what I do everytime I make a commit or merge a pull request!</p>
