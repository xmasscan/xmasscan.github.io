  Find something to believe in, and find it for yourself. When you do,
  pass it on to the future.

<p>Life isn’t just about passing on your genes. We can leave behind much
more than just DNA. Through speech, music, literature and movies… what
we’ve seen, heard, felt… anger, joy and sorrow… these are the things I
will pass on. That’s what I live for. We need to pass the torch, and let
our children read our messy and sad history by its light. We have all
the magic of the digital age to do that with. The human race will
probably come to an end some time, and new species may rule over this
planet. Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility
to leave what traces of life we can. Building the future and keeping the
past alive are one and the same thing.</p>
